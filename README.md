Enterolobium cyclocarpum, commonly known as guanacaste, caro caro, monkey-ear tree or elephant-ear tree, is a species of flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to tropical regions of the Americas, from central Mexico south to northern Brazil (Roraima) and Venezuela.It is known for its large proportions, its expansive, often spherical crown, and its curiously shaped seedpods. The abundance of this tree, especially in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the national tree of Costa Rica.

### Ethnobotanical Encounters
The rich descriptions of ayahuasca ceremonies we know today have been written in the last five decades or so. Yet the few materials that document early encounters with the brew reveal the longstanding religious and intellectual barriers that prevented outsiders from understanding Indigenous knowledge and their worldview.

Jesuits overseeing <span ve-entity title="Mainas missions" eid="Q7125152">missions in the Amazon</span> in the eighteenth century were among the first Europeans to explicitly mention ayahuasca (or _marari_) as a substance for ritual and medicinal purposes. While their main goal was to Christianize peripheral regions, most Jesuits had secular concerns about the use of <span data-click-image-zoomto="2|178,956,586,471">ayahuasca</span>. Missionaries like Pablo Maroni found it difficult to prove whether spiritual leaders had a pact with the devil but were concerned about the divinatory purposes of ayahuasca. In their view, spiritual leaders (usually referred to as sorcerers) were only tricking and deceiving people in their community.

In contrast, descriptions of individual plant species were devoid of demonic or ritual associations. In the late eighteenth century, the Spanish explorers and botanists Hipólito Ruíz and José Pavón led an expedition across present-day Perú, Ecuador, and Chile that covered parts of the Western Amazon. Among the new plant species and genera they <span data-click-image-zoomto="2|1313,1312,1905,1529">described</span> was _Psychotria viridis_. Even though these botanists sought to obtain knowledge from local herbalists and sorcerers [ref], the  hallucinogenic properties and use of _P. viridis_ in ayahuasca brews were never reported. For centuries the synergy between the ayahuasca vine (_B. caapi_) and chacruna (_P. viridis_) remained (purposefully) unknown.

Almost a century later, the Portuguese Manuel Rodrigues Pinto Rubens echoed the Jesuit views on ayahuasca when he wrote about the Ticuna in the Northern Amazon. He recognized the medical specialists of this community (called _pagés_)  but also called them “impostors” who frightened the overly “superstitious indians”  of the region. Pinto Rubens’ work stands out from previous missionary accounts because it has great ethnographic detail about indigenous rituals combined with botanical references to the plants used by the Ticuna. It also features several watercolors, including one of a pagé who apparently is using ayahuasca to understand their patient’s ailment and find a cure.

While Pinto Ruben’s work is certainly ethnobotanical in character, the most celebrated figure in this discipline is Richard Spruce. This well-known Victorian Era botanist travelled for fifteen years across South America and documented extensively the Putumayo region of the Amazon. Spruce gave a binomial name to the most known ayahuasca vine (_Banisteria caapi_) and included a whole section of notes in his posthumous book, _Notes of a Botanist in the Andes and the Amazon_ (1908). Because of this, Spruce is considered to be the pioneer of ayahuasca studies in the modern scientific world.

**Option A- curtain** However, Spruce did not obtain all of the information through first hand interviews and observations. He also relied on scientific networks in the nascent Spanish American republics. Spruce cited and translated the work of Manuel Villavicencio, a Quiteño creole scientist who was governor of the Oriental Provinces in Ecuador. Villavicencio’s scientific project consisted in making extensive geographical studies that would allow him to build a nation free of colonial legacies. To do so he sought to tap into British imperial botanical networks and thus saw fit to share his work with Spruce. Even though Spruce recognized the ethnographic efforts of Villavicencio, he found his botanical description useless. Villavicencio did include other important ethnobotanical details such as the use of a “guayusa” brew (_Illex guayusa_) to purge the ayahuasca drinker before the ceremony.  Interestingly, he also described the diplomatic and warfare uses of the brew in the Zaparo and Jívaro communities. These political uses are now rarely mentioned in ayahuasca literature thus leaving the magical and spiritual connotations of the brew as the most relevant ones.

**Option B - modified text and regular image gallery** However, Spruce did not obtain all of the information through first hand interviews and observations. He also relied on scientific networks in the nascent Spanish American republics. Spruce cited and translated the work of Manuel Villavicencio, a Quiteño creole scientist who had been recently appointed governor of the Oriental Provinces in Ecuador. Not surprisingly, Villavicencio dedicated a sizable portion of his book to this specific region and discussed strategies of incorporating the apparently isolated and wild tribes that lived there. To expand his scientific project he sought to tap into British imperial botanical networks and thus saw fit to share his work with Spruce. Even though Spruce recognized the ethnographic efforts of Villavicencio, he found his botanical description useless. Villavicencio did include other important ethnobotanical details such as the use of a “guayusa” brew (Illex guayusa) to purge the ayahuasca drinker before the ceremony.

Spruce’s work ultimately shaped twentieth century ethnobotanical interests. The famous ethnobotanist Richard Evans Schultes was inspired by _Notes of a Botanist..._ and decidedly followed Spruce’s steps into the Amazon during the 1940s. Schultes lauded the naming of the ayahuasca vine as Spruce’s greatest “discovery” but regretted that the Victorian botanist wasn’t able to experience ayahuasca on his own. It was years after Schultes returned to Harvard and mentioned ayahuasca to a fellow undergraduate, famed novelist William Burroughs, that personal accounts and autoethnographies under the influence of ayahuasca would become popular beginning with Burroughs’ epistolary Colombian odyssey to experience the brew, _The Yage Letters_.

The question then becomes, who, if anyone, owns ayahuasca? In 1986, American Loren Miller tried to patent ayahuasca plant. Back in the late 1970s, this pharmacologist had developed a cultivar in Hawaii of _Banisteriopsis caapi_. He named his patented plants “Da Vine” and founded a company to study its potential benefits. Miller’s actions are best described as __biopiracy__ and were denounced by the Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) in 1994.

The “Da Vine” patent was eventually overturned, but not because the courts recognized the COICA’s claims to their own culture. Rather, a herbarium specimen from the Field Museum in Chicago demonstrated that Miller’s unique plant had in fact been cultivated on US soil before he submitted his patent. In the end, this seemingly simple botanical artifact —a pressed and dried plant with a descriptive label attached to a cardboard— defined what ayahuasca meant in the United States.
